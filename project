Section 3.0
Special Provisions for the Provision of Services to Silicon Labs
When Supplier is providing services to Silicon Labs which are not related to Silicon Labs# production requirements and delivery to its customers and are instead related to its internal operations in the areas of
general administration, finance, facilities or computer information systems of Silicon Labs and any items that are provided to Silicon Labs incidental to the performance of such services (collectively "Services#)
including the performance of Services on or within the offices and facilities of Silicon Labs, and where a separate agreement signed by both parties does not exist, the following additional terms and conditions shall
apply:
3.1 PROPRIETARY INFORMATION
Supplier and Supplier#s employees and contractors ("Supplier#s Personnel#) will promptly and fully disclose, in writing, and do hereby assign to Silicon Labs, its successors or assigns, all right title and interest in
and to any and all inventions, improvements, computer programs, diagrams, designs, creations, ideas, know-how, trade secrets, trademarks, works of authorship, mask works, or improvements, discovered,
conceived and/or developed, whether or not patentable or copyrightable, which Supplier#s Personnel may make, or assist in making, in connection with the performance of Services under this Agreement, or using
Silicon Labs# equipment, data, facilities and/or materials ("Proprietary Information#). Any tangible written expression prepared by Supplier or Supplier#s Personnel, alone or in conjunction with others, pursuant the
performance of Services under this Agreement or as the result thereof ("Written Data#) and which qualifies as a "work-for-hire# under the applicable copyright laws, shall be the exclusive property of Silicon Labs as
"work-for-hire.# All rights, title and interest in Written Data which does not qualify as a "work-for-hire# shall be deemed to have automatically transferred to Silicon Labs from the date of inception. Subject to this
paragraph, all Proprietary Information, files, input materials and output materials, the media on which they are located (including cards, tapes, disks, and other storage facilities), and all software programs or
packages which are utilized or developed solely for, and paid for by, Silicon Labs in connection with the performance of Services under this Agreement shall be the property of Silicon Labs; provided, however, that
Supplier does not convey nor does Silicon Labs obtain any right in previously developed programs, systems, data or materials utilized or provided by Supplier in the ordinary course of business in the performance of
this Agreement. If Supplier or Supplier#s Personnel incorporate previously developed programs, systems, data or material into any work performed under this Agreement, Supplier hereby grants Silicon Labs an
irrevocable non-exclusive worldwide royaltyfree license to use, reproduce, manufacture, sell and distribute said developed programs, systems, data and material that is integrated into any work performed under the
terms of this Agreement. Supplier agrees to do any and all acts, and execute any and all instruments, which Silicon Labs may reasonably request to secure for itself, its successors or assigns, any rights relating to
such Proprietary Information. This obligation shall continue beyond the termination of this Agreement, but Silicon Labs shall compensate Supplier at a reasonable rate for time actually spent by Supplier at Silicon
Labs# request on such assistance.
3.2 WARRANTIES ON SERVICES

(b) The Services provided by Supplier shall be of good quality and performed in a professional and workmanlike manner consistent with the generally accepted standards in the industry and in compliance with any

copyright or patent rights and that Supplier is the owner of or has the right to transfer all proprietary information provided to or incorporated into any deliverable or Services.
(f) Supplier and Supplier#s Personnel that perform the Services possess all licenses and professional certificates required by applicable state laws, and shall maintain such licenses and certificates in active, good
standing throughout the term of this Agreement.
3.3 STAFFING
(a) Upon request, Supplier shall identify to Silicon Labs, before performing any Services, the names, titles, relationship to Supplier (e.g. employee, independent contractor, subcontractor, etc.) and such information as

the term of this Agreement. Further, Supplier shall appoint a primary representative who shall be responsible for day to day contacts between the parties and shall receive copies of all written correspondence
exchanged between the parties.
(b) Silicon Labs may, at any time, request the removal of any of Supplier's Personnel from involvement in the Services. Upon such request, Supplier shall promptly replace such Supplier#s Personnel with another
individual of at least comparable skill and experience.
(c) Silicon Labs shall authorize Supplier#s Personnel to enter the Silicon Labs facility and to use such premises solely for the purpose of providing the Services contemplated by this Agreement. Supplier's use and
access to common areas and other non-proprietary areas at any applicable facility shall be subject to all Silicon Labs security, traffic, and smoke free environment restrictions, as well as Silicon Labs# rules, policies
or procedures, as they may be amended from time to time, and any and all other reasonable restrictions which Silicon Labs may impose from time to time. Access may be limited to Silicon Labs# normal hours of
